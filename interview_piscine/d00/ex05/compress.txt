1:5 And God @` the light Day, and the darkness he @` Night.
And the evening and the morning @ the @• day.

1:6 And God @

and let it divide the waters @ the waters.

1:7 And God @% the firmament, and divided the waters @	 @

7:6 After @ I beheld, and lo @ˆ, @[ a leopard, @	 had

7:15 I Daniel was grieved in my @Ä in the @¯ of my body, and

7:28 Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my

kept the matter in my @E.

8:1 In the third @¬ of the reign of @ Belshazzar a vision

8:2 And I saw in a vision; and it @ to @F, @ I saw, @ I was

8:3 @( I lifted up @a @w, and saw, and, @Q, @ @Â

8:4 I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so
@ no beasts @€ stand @ him, @L was @ any @

8:5 And as I was considering, @Q, an he goat @ @ the west on

8:6 And he @ to the ram @ had two horns, @	 I had seen

8:7 And I saw him @ close @ the ram, and he was moved @

8:11 Yea, he magnified @t @) to the prince of the host, and by

1:15 So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you

1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of @j: for it is the power

1:17 For therein is the @Û of God revealed @ faith to

3:28 @” we conclude @ a man is justified by faith @›

3:29 Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not @! of the Gentiles?

4:4 Now to him @ worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but

4:10 How was it @J reckoned? @ he was in circumcision, or in

4:13 For the promise, @ he @M be the heir of the @æ, was not

4:14 For if @ @	 are of the law be heirs, faith is @% void,

4:16 @” it is of faith, @ it @€ be by grace; to the end

6:12 Let not sin @I reign in @ mortal body, @ ye @M

7:1 Know ye not, @l, (for I @ to @ @ @R the law,)
how @ the law @ dominion @5 a man as long as he liveth?  7:2
For the @µ @	 @ an husband is bound by the law to her husband

7:7 @È @ we say @J? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not

7:8 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all
manner of concupiscence. For @› the law sin was @±.

7:9 For I was alive @› the law once: but @ the commandment

7:10 And the commandment, @	 was ordained to @‰, I @¢ to be

7:11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by

7:12 Wherefore the law is @‚, and the commandment @‚, and just,

7:13 Was @J @ @	 is @V @% @« @ me? God forbid. But
sin, @ it @€ appear sin, working @« in me by @ @	 is

7:14 For we @R @ the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold

7:15 For @ @	 I do I allow not: for @\ I @, @ do I not;

7:16 If @J I do @ @	 I @ not, I consent @ the law @

7:17 Now @J it is no @X I @ do it, but sin @ dwelleth in me.

7:19 For the @V @ I @ I do not: but the @d @	 I @

7:20 Now if I do @ I @ not, it is no @X I @ do it, but sin

7:21 I find @J a law, @, @ I @ do @V, @d is present

7:22 For I delight in the law of God @. the inward man: 7:23 But I

7:24 O wretched man @ I am! who @ deliver me @ the body of

8:1 There is @I now no condemnation to @ @	 are in @j

8:2 For the law of the Spirit of @‰ in @j @8 @ @% me

8:3 For @\ the law could not do, in @ it was weak @‡ the

8:5 For @ @ are @. the @™ do mind the @, of the @™;

8:6 For to be carnally minded is @«; but to be spiritually minded

8:7 Because the carnal mind is enmity @" God: for it is not

8:8 So @J @ @ are in the @™ cannot please God.

8:9 But ye are not in the @™, but in the Spirit, if so be @ the

8:10 And if @j be in you, the body is @± @4 of sin; but the

8:12 @”, @l, we are debtors, not to the @™, to live

8:13 For if ye live @. the @™, ye @ die: but if ye @‡

8:14 For as @s as are led by the Spirit of God, @ are the @/ of

8:15 For ye @ not received the @Ä of bondage @^ to @À; but
ye @ received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.

8:16 The Spirit itself beareth witness @ our @Ä, @ we are

8:18 For I reckon @ the sufferings of @ present @b are not

8:19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the

8:20 For the creature was @% subject to vanity, not willingly, but
by reason of him who @ subjected the @Ê in hope, 8:21 Because the

@ the glorious liberty of the @ of God.

8:22 For we @R @ the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in

8:23 And not only @, but ourselves @!, @	 @ the firstfruits
of the Spirit, @) we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for
the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.

8:24 For we are saved by hope: but hope @ is seen is not hope: for
@\ a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?  8:25 But if we hope for
@ we see not, @J do we @ patience wait for it.

8:26 Likewise the Spirit @! helpeth our infirmities: for we @R not
@\ we @M @Ú for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh

8:27 And he @ searcheth the hearts knoweth @\ is the mind of the

8:28 And we @R @ all @, @š @{ for @V to @ @

8:31 @È @ we @J say to @6 @,? If God be for us, who can

10:1 Brethren, my @E's desire and prayer to God for @ is, @

10:2 For I bear @ record @ @ @ a zeal of God, but not

10:3 For @ being ignorant of God's @Û, and going @_

11:4 But @\ @* the answer of God @ him? I @ reserved to

11:5 Even so @J at @ present @b @! @ is a remnant

11:6 And if by grace, @J is it no @X of works: otherwise grace is

11:7 @È @J? @ @ not obtained @ @	 he seeketh for;

11:12 Now if the fall of @ be the riches of the @æ, and the

11:15 For if the casting @< of @ be the reconciling of the @æ,

For if the firstfruit be @‚, the lump is @! @‚: and if the root

11:17 And if some of the branches be broken off, and @, being a

11:20 Well; @4 of unbelief @ @ broken off, and @

11:23 And @ @!, if @ abide not still in unbelief, @ be

11:24 For if @ wert cut out of the olive tree @	 is wild by

how much @X @ @6, @	 be the natural branches, be graffed

11:29 For the gifts and calling of God are @› repentance.

11:30 For as ye in times past @ not believed God, yet @ now

11:33 O the depth of the riches @¶ of the wisdom and knowledge of

15:1 We @J @ are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the

15:2 Let @+ one of us please his neighbour for his @V to

15:3 For @) @j pleased not @t; but, as it is written, The

1:9 God is faithful, by @P ye @ @` @ the fellowship of his

1:11 For it @ @Ë declared @ me of you, my @l, by @

1:12 Now @ I say, @ @+ one of you @*, I am of Paul; and I

1:13 Is @j divided? was Paul crucified for you? or @ ye

1:16 And I baptized @! the household of Stephanas: besides, I @R

1:17 For @j @Y me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not

1:18 For the preaching of the cross is to @ @ perish
foolishness; but @ us @	 are saved it is the power of God.

1:19 For it is written, I @ destroy the wisdom of the wise, and
@ @Z to nothing the understanding of the prudent.

1:20 Where is the wise? @Î is the scribe? @Î is the disputer of
@ @æ? @ not God @% foolish the wisdom of @ @æ?  1:21
For @. @ in the wisdom of God the @æ by wisdom knew not God,
it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save @ @

1:22 For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek @. wisdom:
1:23 But we preach @j crucified, @ the Jews a stumblingblock,
and @ the Greeks foolishness; 1:24 But @ @ @	 are @`,
@¶ Jews and Greeks, @j the power of God, and the wisdom of God.

1:25 Because the foolishness of God is wiser @} men; and the

1:26 For ye see @ calling, @l, how @ not @s wise men

2:1 And I, @l, @ I @ to you, @ not @ excellency of

2:2 For I determined not to @R any @q @> you, save @8

2:3 And I was @ you in weakness, and in @À, and in much

2:4 And my speech and my preaching was not @ enticing @o of

@Ç @ faith @M not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the

2:6 Howbeit we @ wisdom @> @ @ are perfect: yet not the

2:10 But God @ revealed @ @ us by his Spirit: for the Spirit

2:12 Now we @ received, not the @Ä of the @æ, but the @Ä

2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the @, of the Spirit of

2:15 But he @ is spiritual judgeth all @,, yet he @t is

2:16 For who @ known the mind of the @0, @ he may instruct

3:1 And I, @l, could not @ @ you as @ spiritual, but
as @ carnal, @) as @ babes in @j.

3:2 I @ fed you @ milk, and not @ @å: for hitherto ye @

3:3 For ye are yet carnal: for whereas @ is @> you envying, and

while one @*, I am of Paul; and @ˆ, I am of Apollos; are ye
not carnal?  3:5 Who @J is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers

3:7 So @J @L is he @ planteth any @q, @L he @

3:8 Now he @ planteth and he @ watereth are one: and @+ man

3:9 For we are labourers @{ @ God: ye are God's husbandry, ye

3:10 According to the grace of God @	 is @y @ me, as a wise

3:11 For @„ foundation can no man lay @} @ is laid, @	 is

3:18 Let no man deceive @t. If any man @> you seemeth to be

3:19 For the wisdom of @ @æ is foolishness @ God. For it is

4:6 And @6 @,, @l, I @ in a figure transferred to

4:9 For I think @ God @ set @? us the apostles last, as it

4:10 We are fools for @j's sake, but ye are wise in @j; we are
weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.

4:11 Even @ @ present hour we @¶ hunger, and thirst, and are

as the filth of the @æ, and are the offscouring of all @, @

4:14 I write not @6 @, to shame you, but as my beloved @/ I

4:15 For though ye @ ten @u instructers in @j, yet @

4:16 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.

4:18 Now some are puffed up, as though I @ not @ to you.

4:19 But I @ @ to you shortly, if the @0 @, and @ @R,
not the speech of @ @	 are puffed up, but the power.

4:20 For the @¾ of God is not in @W, but in power.

4:21 @È @ ye? @ I @ @ you @ a rod, or in @Ø, and

5:2 And ye are puffed up, and @ not rather mourned, @ he @

5:3 For I verily, as absent in body, but present in @Ä, @

5:6 Your glorying is not @V. Know ye not @ a little leaven

5:9 I wrote @ you in an epistle not to company @ fornicators:
5:10 Yet not altogether @ the fornicators of @ @æ, or @

5:11 But now I @ written @ you not to @Á company, if any man

5:12 For @\ @ I to do to judge @ @! @ are @›? do not

6:1 Dare any of you, having a matter @" @ˆ, go to law @

6:4 If @J ye @ judgments of @, pertaining to @ @‰, set

6:5 I @ to @ shame. Is it so, @ @ is not a wise man

6:7 Now @I @ is utterly a fault @> you, @4 ye go to

6:9 Know ye not @ the unrighteous @ not inherit the @¾ of

6:10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor

6:11 And such @ some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are
sanctified, but ye are justified in the @9 of the @0 @8, and by
the Spirit of our God.

6:12 All @, are lawful @ me, but all @, are not expedient:
all @, are lawful for me, but I @ not be @B @§ the
power of any.

6:13 Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God @
destroy @¶ it and @. Now the body is not for fornication, but for
the @0; and the @0 for the body.

6:14 And God @ @¶ raised up the @0, and @ @! raise up us
by his own power.

6:15 Know ye not @ @ bodies are the members of @j? @ I
@J @U the members of @j, and @3 @ the members of an

6:16 @È? @R ye not @ he @	 is joined to an harlot is one

6:17 But he @ is joined @ the @0 is one @Ä.

6:18 Flee fornication. Every sin @ a man doeth is @› the body;
but he @ committeth fornication sinneth @" his own body.

6:19 @È? @R ye not @ @ body is the temple of the Holy Ghost
@	 is in you, @	 ye @ of God, and ye are not @ own?  6:20
For ye are bought @ a price: @I glorify God in @ body,
and in @ @Ä, @	 are God's.

7:1 Now concerning the @, whereof ye wrote @ me: It is @V for
a man not to touch a @µ.

7:2 Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let @+ man @ his own
@Ÿ, and let @+ @µ @ her own husband.

7:3 Let the husband render @ the @Ÿ due benevolence: and likewise
@! the @Ÿ @ the husband.

7:4 The @Ÿ @ not power of her own body, but the husband: and
likewise @! the husband @ not power of his own body, but the
@Ÿ.

7:5 Defraud ye not one the @„, except it be @ consent for a
@b, @ ye may @K yourselves to fasting and prayer; and @
@{ @^, @ Satan tempt you not for @ incontinency.

7:6 But I @ @ by permission, and not of commandment.

7:7 For I @ @ all men @ @) as I myself. But @+ man @
his proper gift of God, one @. @ manner, and @ˆ @. @.

7:8 I say @I to the unmarried and widows, It is @V for @
if @ abide @) as I.

7:9 But if @ cannot contain, let @ marry: for it is better to
marry @} to burn.

7:10 And @ the married I command, yet not I, but the @0, Let not
the @Ÿ depart @ her husband: 7:11 But and if she depart, let her
remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the
husband put @< his @Ÿ.

7:12 But to the rest @ I, not the @0: If any @¤ @ a @Ÿ
@ believeth not, and she be pleased to @Å @ him, let him not
put her @<.

7:13 And the @µ @	 @ an husband @ believeth not, and if he
be pleased to @Å @ her, let her not leave him.

7:14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the @Ÿ, and the
unbelieving @Ÿ is sanctified by the husband: else @ @ @
unclean; but now are @ @‚.

7:15 But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A @¤ or a
sister is not @§ bondage in such cases: but God @ @` us to
@¡.

7:16 For @\ knowest @, O @Ÿ, whether @ @# save thy
husband?  or how knowest @, O man, whether @ @# save thy
@Ÿ?  7:17 But as God @ distributed to @+ man, as the @0 @
@` @+ one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.

7:18 Is any man @` being circumcised? let him not become
uncircumcised. Is any @` in uncircumcision? let him not be
circumcised.

7:19 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the
keeping of the commandments of God.

7:20 Let @+ man abide in the @Ê calling wherein he was @`.

7:21 Art @ @` being a @x? care not for it: but if @
mayest be @% free, use it rather.

7:22 For he @ is @` in the @0, being a @x, is the @0's
freeman: likewise @! he @ is @`, being free, is @j's
@x.

7:23 Ye are bought @ a price; be not ye the @ of men.

7:24 Brethren, let @+ man, wherein he is @`, therein abide @
God.

7:25 Now concerning virgins I @ no commandment of the @0: yet I
@K my @ß, as one @ @ obtained mercy of the @0 to be
faithful.

7:26 I suppose @I @ @ is @V for the present distress, I
say, @ it is @V for a man so to be.

7:27 Art @ bound @ a @Ÿ? seek not to be loosed. Art @
loosed @ a @Ÿ? seek not a @Ÿ.

7:28 But and if @ marry, @ @2 not sinned; and if a virgin
marry, she @ not sinned. Nevertheless such @ @ trouble in
the @™: but I spare you.

7:29 But @ I say, @l, the @b is short: it remaineth, @
@¶ @ @ @ wives be as though @ had @»; 7:30 And @
@ weep, as though @ wept not; and @ @ rejoice, as though
@ rejoiced not; and @ @ buy, as though @ possessed not;
7:31 And @ @ use @ @æ, as not abusing it: for the fashion
of @ @æ passeth @<.

7:32 But I @ @ you @› carefulness. He @ is unmarried
careth for the @, @ belong to the @0, how he may please the
@0: 7:33 But he @ is married careth for the @, @ are of
the @æ, how he may please his @Ÿ.

7:34 There is difference @! between a @Ÿ and a virgin. The
unmarried @µ careth for the @, of the @0, @ she may be
@‚ @¶ in body and in @Ä: but she @ is married careth for
the @, of the @æ, how she may please her husband.

7:35 And @ I @ for @ own profit; not @ I may @| a snare
@ you, but for @ @	 is comely, and @ ye may attend @
the @0 @› distraction.

7:36 But if any man think @ he behaveth @t uncomely @¼ his
virgin, if she @F the flower of her age, and need so require, let
him do @\ he @, he sinneth not: let @ marry.

7:37 Nevertheless he @ standeth stedfast in his @E, having no
necessity, but @ power @5 his own @, and @ so decreed in
his @E @ he @ @Á his virgin, doeth well.

7:38 So @J he @ giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he @
giveth her not in marriage doeth better.

7:39 The @Ÿ is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but
if her husband be @±, she is at liberty to be married to @P she
@; only in the @0.

7:40 But she is happier if she so abide, @. my @ß: and I
think @! @ I @ the Spirit of God.

8:1 Now as touching @, offered @ idols, we @R @ we all
@ knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.

8:2 And if any man think @ he knoweth any @q, he knoweth nothing
yet as he ought to @R.

8:3 But if any man @Ø God, the @Ê is known of him.

8:4 As concerning @I the eating of @Ž @, @ are
offered in sacrifice @ idols, we @R @ an idol is nothing in
the @æ, and @ @ is @» @„ God but one.

8:5 For though @ be @ are @` gods, whether in @i or in
@7, (as @ be gods @s, and lords @s,) 8:6 But to us @ is
but one God, the Father, of @P are all @,, and we in him; and
one @0 @8 @j, by @P are all @,, and we by him.

8:7 Howbeit @ is not in @+ man @ knowledge: for some @
conscience of the idol @ @ hour eat it as a @q offered @
an idol; and @ conscience being weak is defiled.

8:8 But @å commendeth us not to God: for @L, if we eat, are we
the better; @L, if we eat not, are we the worse.

8:9 But @U heed lest by any means @ liberty of @'s become a
stumblingblock to @ @ are weak.

8:10 For if any man see @ @	 @2 knowledge sit at @å in the

emboldened to eat @Ž @, @	 are offered to idols; 8:11 And
@‡ thy knowledge @ the weak @¤ perish, for @P @j
died?  8:12 But @ ye sin so @" the @l, and wound @
weak conscience, ye sin @" @j.

8:13 Wherefore, if @å @3 my @¤ to offend, I @ eat no @™
while the @æ standeth, lest I @3 my @¤ to offend.

9:1 Am I not an apostle? am I not free? @ I not seen @8 @j
our @0? are not ye my @š in the @0?  9:2 If I be not an apostle
@ others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of @a
apostleship are ye in the @0.

9:3 Mine answer to @ @ do examine me is @, 9:4 Have we not
power to eat and to @²?  9:5 Have we not power to lead @_ a

who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit @=? or who
feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?  9:8 Say I
@6 @, as a man? or @* not the law the @Ê @!?  9:9 For it
is written in the law of @D, @h @# not muzzle the @– of the

@* he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, @ is
written: @ he @ ploweth @M plow in hope; and @ he @
thresheth in hope @M be partaker of his hope.

9:11 If we @ sown @ you spiritual @,, is it a @: @q if
we @ reap @ carnal @,?  9:12 If others be partakers of @

9:13 Do ye not @R @ @ @	 minister @_ @‚ @, live of

9:16 For though I preach the gospel, I @ nothing to @¥ of: for

9:18 @È is my reward @J? Verily @, @ I preach the gospel, I

9:19 For though I be free @ all men, yet @ I @% myself @x

9:25 And @+ man @ striveth for the mastery is temperate in all

9:26 I @I so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one

10:1 Moreover, @l, I @ not @ ye @M be ignorant, how

10:7 Neither be ye idolaters, as @ some of @; as it is written,

10:11 Now all @6 @, happened @ @ for ensamples: and @

10:13 There @ no temptation @Ã you but such as is common to man:

10:16 The cup of blessing @	 we bless, is it not the communion of

10:18 @e @ @. the @™: are not @ @	 eat of the

10:21 Ye cannot @² the cup of the @0, and the cup of devils: ye

10:22 Do we provoke the @0 to jealousy? are we stronger @} he?
10:23 All @, are lawful for me, but all @, are not expedient:

10:24 Let no man seek his own, but @+ man @ˆ's wealth.

10:25 Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, @ eat, asking no question

10:27 If any of @ @ believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be

10:28 But if any man say @ you, @Ì is offered in sacrifice @

for the @7 is the @0's, and the fulness @=: 10:29
Conscience, I say, not @; own, but of the @„: for why is my

11:1 Be ye followers of me, @) as I @! am of @j.

11:2 Now I praise you, @l, @ ye remember me in all @,,

11:5 But @+ @µ @ prayeth or prophesieth @ her @°

11:6 For if the @µ be not covered, let her @! be shorn: but if it
be a shame for a @µ to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.

11:7 For a man indeed ought not to cover his @°, forasmuch as he is

11:8 For the man is not of the @µ: but the @µ of the man.

11:9 Neither was the man created for the @µ; but the @µ for the

11:11 Nevertheless @L is the man @› the @µ, @L the

11:12 For as the @µ is of the man, @) so is the man @! by the

11:13 Judge in yourselves: is it comely @ a @µ @Ú @ God

11:16 But if any man seem to be contentious, we @ no such custom,

11:18 For @• of all, @ ye @ @{ in the church, I @“
@ @ be divisions @> you; and I partly believe it.

11:19 For @ must be @! heresies @> you, @ @ @	 are

11:20 @¸ ye @ @{ @I @ one @T, @ is not to

11:21 For in eating @+ one taketh @ @„ his own supper: and

11:22 @È? @ ye not houses to eat and to @² in? or despise ye
the church of God, and shame @ @ @ not? @È @ I say to

11:23 For I @ received of the @0 @ @	 @! I @ä @

11:25 After the @Ê manner @! he @O the cup, @ he had supped,

11:26 For as often as ye eat @ @´, and @² @ cup, ye do

11:27 Wherefore whosoever @ eat @ @´, and @² @ cup of

11:28 But let a man examine @t, and so let him eat of @ @´,

11:29 For he @ eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
damnation to @t, not discerning the @0's body.

11:30 For @ @Ò @s are weak and sickly @> you, and @s

11:31 For if we @ judge ourselves, we @M not be judged.

11:32 But @ we are judged, we are chastened of the @0, @ we

11:33 Wherefore, my @l, @ ye @ @{ to eat, tarry one

11:34 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; @ ye @ not

@.

12:1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, @l, I @ not @ you
ignorant.

12:2 Ye @R @ ye @ Gentiles, carried @< @ @6 dumb
idols, @) as ye @ led.

12:3 Wherefore I @K you to understand, @ no man speaking by the
Spirit of God calleth @8 accursed: and @ no man can say @
@8 is the @0, but by the Holy Ghost.

12:4 Now @ are diversities of gifts, but the @Ê Spirit.

12:5 And @ are differences of administrations, but the @Ê @0.

12:6 And @ are diversities of operations, but it is the @Ê God
@	 worketh all in all.

12:7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is @y to @+ man to
profit withal.

12:8 For to one is @y by the Spirit the @W of wisdom; to @ˆ
the @W of knowledge by the @Ê Spirit; 12:9 To @ˆ faith by the
@Ê Spirit; to @ˆ the gifts of healing by the @Ê Spirit; 12:10
To @ˆ the working of miracles; to @ˆ prophecy; to @ˆ
discerning of spirits; to @ˆ divers kinds of tongues; to @ˆ
the interpretation of tongues: 12:11 But all @6 worketh @ one
and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to @+ man severally as he @.

12:12 For as the body is one, and @ @s members, and all the
members of @ one body, being @s, are one body: so @! is @j.

12:13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized @ one body, whether we
be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and @ @Ë all
@% to @² @ one Spirit.

12:14 For the body is not one member, but @s.

12:15 If the foot @ say, Because I am not the @$, I am not of
the body; is it @I not of the body?  12:16 And if the ear @
say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it @I
not of the body?  12:17 If the whole body @ an eye, @Î @ the
hearing? If the whole @ hearing, @Î @ the smelling?  12:18
But now @ God set the members @+ one of @ in the body, as it
@ pleased him.

12:19 And if @ @ all one member, @Î @ the body?  12:20 But
now are @ @s members, yet but one body.

12:21 And the eye cannot say @ the @$, I @ no need of @:
nor @^ the @° to the feet, I @ no need of you.

12:22 Nay, much @X @Ž members of the body, @	 seem to be @X
feeble, are necessary: 12:23 And @Ž members of the body, @	 we
think to be less honourable, @ @6 we bestow @X abundant
honour; and our uncomely parts @ @X abundant comeliness.

12:24 For our comely parts @ no need: but God @ tempered the
body @{, having @y @X abundant honour to @ part @	
lacked.

12:25 @Ç @ @M be no schism in the body; but @ the members
@M @ the @Ê care one for @ˆ.

12:26 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer @ it;
or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice @ it.

12:27 Now ye are the body of @j, and members in particular.

12:28 And God @ set some in the church, @• apostles, secondarily
prophets, thirdly teachers, @. @ miracles, @J gifts of
healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.

12:29 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all
workers of miracles?  12:30 Have all the gifts of healing? do all
@ @ tongues? do all interpret?  12:31 But covet earnestly the
best gifts: and yet shew I @ you a @X excellent way.

13:1 Though I @ @ the tongues of men and of angels, and @
not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

13:2 And though I @ the gift of prophecy, and understand all
mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I @ all faith, so @ I
could remove mountains, and @ not charity, I am nothing.

13:3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I
@K my body to be burned, and @ not charity, it profiteth me
nothing.

13:4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity
vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, 13:5 Doth not behave itself
unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no
@d; 13:6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; 13:7
Beareth all @,, believeth all @,, hopeth all @,, endureth
all @,.

13:8 Charity never faileth: but whether @ be prophecies, @
@ fail; whether @ be tongues, @ @ cease; whether @
be knowledge, it @ vanish @<.

13:9 For we @R in part, and we prophesy in part.

13:10 But @ @ @	 is perfect is @, @J @ @	 is in
part @ be @k @<.

13:11 @¸ I was a child, I @g as a child, I understood as a child,
I thought as a child: but @ I became a man, I put @< childish
@,.

13:12 For now we see @‡ a glass, darkly; but @J @ to @:
now I @R in part; but @J @ I @R @) as @! I am known.

13:13 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, @6 @~; but the
greatest of @6 is charity.

14:1 Follow @. charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather @
ye may prophesy.

14:2 For he @ speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not @ men,
but @ God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the @Ä he
speaketh mysteries.

14:3 But he @ prophesieth speaketh @ men to edification, and
exhortation, and comfort.

14:4 He @ speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth @t; but he
@ prophesieth edifieth the church.

14:5 I @ @ ye all @g @ tongues but rather @ ye

@ tongues, except he interpret, @ the church may receive

14:6 Now, @l, if I @ @ you speaking @ tongues, @\
@ I profit you, except I @ @ to you either by revelation,
or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?  14:7 And @)
@, @› @‰ giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except @
@K a distinction in the sounds, how @ it be known @\ is piped

by the tongue @o easy to be understood, how @ it be known @\
is spoken? for ye @ @ @ the air.

14:10 There are, it may be, so @s kinds of voices in the @æ, and

14:11 @” if I @R not the meaning of the @v, I @ be
@ him @ speaketh a barbarian, and he @ speaketh @ be a

14:12 Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek
@ ye may excel to the edifying of the church.

14:13 Wherefore let him @ speaketh in an unknown tongue @Ú @
he may interpret.

14:14 For if I @Ú in an unknown tongue, my @Ä prayeth, but my
understanding is unfruitful.

14:15 @È is it @J? I @ @Ú @ the @Ä, and I @ @Ú
@ the understanding @!: I @ sing @ the @Ä, and I @

14:16 Else @ @ @# bless @ the @Ä, how @ he @
occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks,
seeing he understandeth not @\ @ sayest?  14:17 For @ verily

14:18 I thank my God, I @ @ tongues @X @} ye all: 14:19 Yet
in the church I had rather @ @¿ @o @ my understanding,
@ by my @v I @€ teach others @!, @} ten @u @o in

14:20 Brethren, be not @ in understanding: howbeit in malice be
ye @, but in understanding be men.

14:21 In the law it is written, With men of @„ tongues and @„
lips @ I @ @ @ @; and yet for all @ @ @ not
@“ me, @* the @.

14:22 Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to @ @ believe, but
to @ @ believe not: but prophesying serveth not for @ @
believe not, but for @ @	 believe.

14:23 If @I the whole church be @ @{ @ one @T,
and all @ @ tongues, and @ @ in @Ž @ are

But if all prophesy, and @ @ in one @ believeth not, or one

are the secrets of his @E @% manifest; and so falling @- on his

14:26 How is it @J, @l? @ ye @ @{, @+ one of
you @ a psalm, @ a doctrine, @ a tongue, @ a revelation,
@ an interpretation. Let all @, be @k @ edifying.

14:27 If any man @ in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at
the most by @~, and @ by course; and let one interpret.

14:28 But if @ be no interpreter, let him @Á silence in the
church; and let him @ to @t, and to God.

14:29 Let the prophets @ two or @~, and let the @„ judge.

14:30 If any @q be revealed to @ˆ @ sitteth by, let the
@• hold his @¡.

14:31 For ye may all prophesy one by one, @ all may learn, and all
may be comforted.

14:32 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.

14:33 For God is not the author of confusion, but of @¡, as in all
churches of the saints.

14:34 Let @ women @Á silence in the churches: for it is not
permitted @ @ to @; but @ are @‘ to be @§

14:35 And if @ @ learn any @q, let @ ask @ husbands at

14:36 @È? @ the @W of God out @ you? or @ it @ you

let him acknowledge @ the @, @ I write @ you are the

14:38 But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.

14:39 Wherefore, @l, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to @
@ tongues.

14:40 Let all @, be @k decently and in order.

15:1 Moreover, @l, I declare @ you the gospel @	 I
preached @ you, @	 @! ye @ received, and wherein ye stand;
15:2 By @	 @! ye are saved, if ye @Á in memory @\ I preached
@ you, unless ye @ believed in vain.

15:3 For I @ä @ you @• of all @ @	 I @! received,
how @ @j died for our sins @N to the scriptures; 15:4
And @ he was buried, and @ he rose @^ the third day @N
to the scriptures: 15:5 And @ he was seen of Cephas, @J of the
twelve: 15:6 After @, he was seen of above @¿ @f @l at
once; of @P the greater part remain @ @ present, but some are
fallen asleep.

15:7 After @, he was seen of James; @J of all the apostles.

15:8 And last of all he was seen of me @!, as of one born out of due
@b.

15:9 For I am the least of the apostles, @ am not meet to be @`
an apostle, @4 I persecuted the church of God.

15:10 But by the grace of God I am @\ I am: and his grace @	 was

@ all: yet not I, but the grace of God @	 was @ me.

15:11 @” whether it @ I or @, so we preach, and so ye
believed.

15:12 Now if @j be preached @ he rose @ the @±, how say
some @> you @ @ is no resurrection of the @±?  15:13 But
if @ be no resurrection of the @±, @J is @j not risen:
15:14 And if @j be not risen, @J is our preaching vain, and @
faith is @! vain.

15:15 Yea, and we are @¢ false witnesses of God; @4 we @
testified of God @ he raised up @j: @P he raised not up, if
so be @ the @± rise not.

15:16 For if the @± rise not, @J is not @j raised: 15:17 And
if @j be not raised, @ faith is vain; ye are yet in @ sins.

15:18 @( @ @! @	 are fallen asleep in @j are perished.

15:19 If in @ @‰ only we @ hope in @j, we are of all men
most miserable.

15:20 But now is @j risen @ the @±, and become the
firstfruits of @ @ slept.

15:21 For since by man @ @«, by man @ @! the resurrection
of the @±.

15:22 For as in Adam all die, @) so in @j @ all be @%
alive.

15:23 But @+ man in his own order: @j the firstfruits;
afterward @ @ are @j's at his coming.

15:24 @( cometh the end, @ he @ @ @ä up the @¾

15:25 For he must reign, till he @ put all enemies @§ his feet.

15:26 The last enemy @ @ be destroyed is @«.

15:27 For he @ put all @, @§ his feet. But @ he @* all

15:28 And @ all @, @ be subdued @ him, @J @ the

@ God may be all in all.

15:29 Else @\ @ @ do @	 are baptized for the @±, if the

And why stand we in jeopardy @+ hour?  15:31 I protest by @
rejoicing @	 I @ in @j @8 our @, I die daily.

15:32 If @. the manner of men I @ fought @ beasts at Ephesus,
@\ advantageth it me, if the @± rise not? let us eat and @²;
for to morrow we die.

15:33 Be not deceived: @d communications corrupt @V manners.

15:34 Awake to @Û, and sin not; for some @ not the
knowledge of God: I @ @ to @ shame.

15:35 But some man @ say, How are the @± raised up? and @ @\
body do @ @?  15:36 @h fool, @ @	 @ sowest is not
quickened, except it die: 15:37 And @ @	 @ sowest, @
sowest not @ body @ @ be, but bare grain, it may chance of
wheat, or of some @„ grain: 15:38 But God giveth it a body as it
@ pleased him, and to @+ seed his own body.

15:39 All @™ is not the @Ê @™: but @ is one kind of @™
of men, @ˆ @™ of beasts, @ˆ of fishes, and @ˆ of
birds.

15:40 There are @! celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the
@¥ of the celestial is one, and the @¥ of the terrestrial is
@ˆ.

15:41 There is one @¥ of the sun, and @ˆ @¥ of the moon,
and @ˆ @¥ of the stars: for one star differeth @ @ˆ
star in @¥.

15:42 So @! is the resurrection of the @±. It is sown in
corruption; it is raised in incorruption: 15:43 It is sown in
dishonour; it is raised in @¥: it is sown in weakness; it is raised
in power: 15:44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual
body. There is a natural body, and @ is a spiritual body.

15:45 And so it is written, The @• man Adam was @% a living @†;
the last Adam was @% a quickening @Ä.

15:46 Howbeit @ was not @• @	 is spiritual, but @ @	 is

15:47 The @• man is of the @7, earthy; the second man is the

15:48 As is the earthy, such are @ @! @ are earthy: and as is
the heavenly, such are @ @! @ are heavenly.

15:49 And as we @ borne the image of the earthy, we @ @! bear
the image of the heavenly.

15:50 Now @ I say, @l, @ @™ and @Œ cannot inherit
the @¾ of God; @L doth corruption inherit incorruption.

15:51 @e, I shew you a mystery; We @ not all sleep, but we

at the last trump: for the trumpet @ sound, and the @± @ be
raised incorruptible, and we @ be changed.

15:53 For @ corruptible must put on incorruption, and @ mortal

15:54 So @ @ corruptible @ @ put on incorruption, and
@ mortal @ @ put on immortality, @J @ be @B to
@F the @' @ is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

15:55 O @«, @Î is thy sting? O grave, @Î is thy victory?
15:56 The sting of @« is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.

15:57 But thanks be to God, @	 giveth us the victory @‡ our

15:58 @”, my beloved @l, be ye stedfast, unmoveable,

16:8 But I @ tarry at Ephesus @º Pentecost.

1:1 Paul, an apostle of @8 @j by the @ of God, and Timothy

1:12 For our rejoicing is @, the testimony of our conscience, @
in simplicity and godly sincerity, not @ fleshly wisdom, but by the

abundantly to you-ward.

1:13 For we write @» @„ @, @ you, @} @\ ye read or

@! ye @ acknowledged us in part, @ we are @ rejoicing, @)
as ye @! are our's in the day of the @0 @8.

1:15 And in @ confidence I was minded to @ @ you @, @
ye @€ @ a second benefit; 1:16 And to @F by you @

1:17 @¸ I @I was @ã minded, did I use lightness? or the

1:19 For the Son of God, @8 @j, who was preached @> you by
us, @) by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in
him was yea.

1:20 For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, @
the @¥ of God by us.

1:21 Now he @	 stablisheth us @ you in @j, and @ anointed

1:23 Moreover I call God for a record @ my @†, @ to spare you
I @ not as yet @ Corinth.

1:24 Not for @ we @ dominion @5 @ faith, but are helpers of

2:1 But I determined @ @ myself, @ I @ not @ @^ to

2:2 For if I @3 you sorry, who is he @J @ maketh me glad, but

2:4 For out of much affliction and anguish of @E I wrote @ you

2:5 But if any @ caused grief, he @ not grieved me, but in part:
@ I may not overcharge you all.

2:6 Sufficient to such a man is @ punishment, @	 was inflicted

2:7 So @ contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort
him, lest perhaps such a one @M be swallowed up @ overmuch
sorrow.

2:8 Wherefore I beseech you @ ye @ confirm @ @Ø @¼

2:9 For to @ end @! did I write, @ I @€ @R the proof of

2:10 To @P ye forgive any @q, I forgive @!: for if I forgave
any @q, to @P I forgave it, for @ sakes forgave I it in the

we are not ignorant of his devices.

2:12 Furthermore, @ I @ to Troas to preach @j's gospel, and
a door was opened @ me of the @0, 2:13 I had no rest in my

2:14 Now thanks be @ God, @	 always causeth us to triumph in

2:15 For we are @ God a sweet savour of @j, in @ @ are

@« @ @«; and to the @„ the savour of @‰ @ @‰. And
who is sufficient for @6 @,?  2:17 For we are not as @s,
@	 corrupt the @W of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in
the @É of God @ we in @j.

3:1 Do we begin @^ to commend ourselves? or need we, as some
others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation
@ you?  3:2 Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and
read of all men: 3:3 Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the
epistle of @j ministered by us, written not @ ink, but @ the
Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables
of the @E.

3:4 And such trust @ we @‡ @j to God-ward: 3:5 Not @ we
are sufficient of ourselves to think any @q as of ourselves; but
our sufficiency is of God; 3:6 Who @! @ @% us able ministers of

3:7 But if the ministration of @«, written and engraven in stones,
was glorious, so @ the @ of @ could not stedfastly
@Q the @ of @D for the @¥ of his countenance; @	 @¥
was to be @k @<: 3:8 How @ not the ministration of the @Ä

@¥.

3:10 For @) @ @	 was @% glorious had no @¥ in @

3:11 For if @ @	 is @k @< was glorious, much @X @ @

3:12 Seeing @J @ we @ such hope, we use @: plainness of

the @ of @ could not stedfastly look to the end of @
@	 is abolished: 3:14 But @ minds @ blinded: for @º @

3:15 But @) @ @ day, @ @D is read, the vail is @

3:16 Nevertheless @ it @ turn to the @0, the vail @ be

3:17 Now the @0 is @ Spirit: and @Î the Spirit of the @0 is,

3:18 But we all, @ open @ beholding as in a glass the @¥ of

4:1 @” seeing we @ @ ministry, as we @ received mercy,
we faint not; 4:2 But @ renounced the hidden @, of dishonesty,
not walking in craftiness, nor handling the @W of God deceitfully;
but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to @+ man's

4:3 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to @ @ are lost: 4:4 In
@P the god of @ @æ @ blinded the minds of @ @

4:5 For we preach not ourselves, but @j @8 the @0; and

4:6 For God, who @‘ the light to shine out of darkness, @

4:7 But we @ @ treasure in earthen vessels, @ the excellency

4:8 We are troubled on @+ @’, yet not distressed; we are

@-, but not destroyed; 4:10 Always bearing @_ in the body the

4:11 For we @	 live are alway @ä @ @« for @8' sake,

4:12 So @J @« worketh in us, but @‰ in you.

4:13 We having the @Ê @Ä of faith, @N as it is written, I

4:15 For all @, are for @ sakes, @ the abundant grace @€

4:16 For @	 @Ò we faint not; but though our outward man perish,
yet the inward man is renewed day by day.

4:17 For our light affliction, @	 is but for a moment, worketh for
us a far @X exceeding and eternal weight of @¥; 4:18 While we
look not at the @, @	 are seen, but at the @, @	 are not
seen: for the @, @	 are seen are temporal; but the @, @

5:1 For we @R @ if our earthly @ of @ @Ï @

5:2 For in @ we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed @ @
our @ @	 is @ @i: 5:3 If so be @ being clothed we

5:4 For we @ are in @ @Ï do groan, being burdened: not

5:5 Now he @ @ wrought us for the selfsame @q is God, who
@! @ @y @ us the earnest of the Spirit.

5:6 @” we are always confident, knowing @, whilst we are at
home in the body, we are absent @ the @0: 5:7 (For we walk by

to be absent @ the body, and to be present @ the @0.

5:9 Wherefore we labour, @, whether present or absent, we may be

5:10 For we must all appear @ the @ß seat of @j; @
@+ one may receive the @, @k in his body, @N to @

5:11 Knowing @I the terror of the @0, we persuade men; but we

5:12 For we commend not ourselves @^ @ you, but @K you

@ @	 @¥ in appearance, and not in @E.

5:13 For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we

5:14 For the @Ø of @j constraineth us; @4 we @ã judge,
@ if one died for all, @J @ all @±: 5:15 And @ he died

5:16 Wherefore henceforth @R we no man @. the @™: yea, though

5:17 @” if any man be in @j, he is a new creature: old
@, are passed @<; @Q, all @, are become new.

5:18 And all @, are of God, who @ reconciled us to @t by

5:19 To wit, @ God was in @j, reconciling the @æ @

5:20 Now @J we are ambassadors for @j, as though God did beseech

6:2 (For he @*, I @ @] @ in a @b accepted, and in the

By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy

God, by the armour of @Û on the @³ @$ and on the @¹,
6:8 By honour and dishonour, by @d report and @V report: as

6:11 O ye Corinthians, our @– is open @ you, our @E is

6:12 Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in @ own

6:13 Now for a recompence in the @Ê, (I @ as @ my @,)

6:14 Be ye not unequally yoked @{ @ unbelievers: for @\

6:17 Wherefore @ out @ @> @, and be ye separate, @* the

7:1 Having @I @6 promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse

7:2 Receive us; we @ wronged no man, we @ corrupted no man, we

7:3 I @ not @ to condemn you: for I @ @

7:4 Great is my boldness of speech @¼ you, @: is my glorying of

7:5 For, @ we @ @ @ Macedonia, our @™ had no rest, but

7:6 Nevertheless God, @ comforteth @Ž @ are @| @-,
comforted us by the coming of Titus; 7:7 And not by his coming only,
but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, @ he told
us @ earnest desire, @ mourning, @ fervent mind @¼ me; so
@ I rejoiced the @X.

7:8 For though I @% you sorry @ a letter, I do not repent, though

7:9 Now I rejoice, not @ ye @ @% sorry, but @ ye sorrowed
to repentance: for ye @ @% sorry @. a godly manner, @ ye

7:10 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be

7:11 For @Q @ selfsame @q, @ ye sorrowed @. a godly

7:12 Wherefore, though I wrote @ you, I did it not for his @Ò

7:13 @” we @ comforted in @ comfort: yea, and exceedingly

7:14 For if I @ boasted any @q to him of you, I am not ashamed;

7:15 And his inward affection is @X abundant @¼ you, whilst he

7:16 I rejoice @I @ I @ confidence in you in all @,.

8:1 Moreover, @l, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed
on the churches of Macedonia; 8:2 How @ in a @: trial of

@ the riches of @ liberality.

8:3 For to @ power, I bear record, yea, and beyond @ power

8:5 And @ @ did, not as we hoped, but @• @ƒ @ own

8:6 Insomuch @ we desired Titus, @ as he had begun, so he @
@! finish in you the @Ê grace @!.

8:7 @”, as ye abound in @+ @q, in faith, and utterance,

ye abound in @ grace @!.

8:8 I @ not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of

8:9 For ye @R the grace of our @0 @8 @j, @, though he

8:10 And herein I @K my advice: for @ is expedient for you, who
@ begun @, not only to do, but @! to be forward a @¬ ago.

8:11 Now @I perform the doing of it; @ as @ was a
readiness to @, so @ may be a performance @! out of @
@	 ye @.

8:12 For if @ be @• a willing mind, it is accepted @N to
@ a man @, and not @N to @ he @ not.

8:13 For I mean not @ @„ men be eased, and ye burdened: 8:14 But
by an equality, @ now at @ @b @ abundance may be a supply
for @ want, @ @ abundance @! may be a supply for @

lack.

8:16 But thanks be to God, @	 put the @Ê earnest care @ the

8:17 For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being @X forward,
of his own accord he @& @ you.

8:18 And we @ @Y @ him the @¤, whose praise is in the

@	 is administered by us to the @¥ of the @Ê @0, and

8:22 And we @ @Y @ @ our @¤, @P we @ oftentimes

8:23 Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and
fellowhelper concerning you: or our @l be enquired of, @ are
the messengers of the churches, and the @¥ of @j.

8:24 Wherefore shew ye to @, and @ the churches, the proof of
@ @Ø, and of our boasting on @ behalf.

9:1 For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous
for me to write to you: 9:2 For I @R the forwardness of @ mind,
for @	 I boast of you to @ of Macedonia, @ Achaia was ready a

9:3 Yet @ I @Y the @l, lest our boasting of you @M be

haply if @ of Macedonia @ @ me, and find you unprepared, we
(@ we say not, ye) @M be ashamed in @ @Ê confident

9:5 @” I thought it necessary to exhort the @l, @ @
@ go @ @ you, and @3 up beforehand @ bounty, whereof
ye had notice @, @ the @Ê @€ be ready, as a matter of

9:6 But @ I say, He @	 soweth sparingly @ reap @!
sparingly; and he @	 soweth bountifully @ reap @!
bountifully.

9:7 Every man @N as he purposeth in his @E, so let him @K;
not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.

9:8 And God is able to @3 all grace abound @¼ you; @ ye,
always having all sufficiency in all @,, may abound to @+ @V
@š: 9:9 (As it is written, He @ dispersed abroad; he @ @y

9:10 Now he @ ministereth seed to the sower @¶ minister @´ for
@ food, and multiply @ seed sown, and increase the fruits of
@ @Û;) 9:11 Being enriched in @+ @q to all
bountifulness, @	 causeth @‡ us thanksgiving to God.

9:12 For the administration of @ service not only supplieth the
want of the saints, but is abundant @! by @s thanksgivings @
God; 9:13 Whiles by the experiment of @ ministration @ glorify

9:15 Thanks be @ God for his unspeakable gift.

10:1 Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of

@¼ you: 10:2 But I beseech you, @ I may not be bold @ I am

some, @	 think of us as if we walked @N to the @™.

10:3 For though we walk in the @™, we do not war @. the @™:
10:4 (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty
@‡ God to the pulling @- of strong holds;) 10:5 Casting @-
imaginations, and @+ @¨ @q @ exalteth itself @" the

10:7 Do ye look on @, @. the outward appearance? If any man
trust to @t @ he is @j's, let him of @t think @
@^, @, as he is @j's, @) so are we @j's.

10:8 For though I @M boast somewhat @X of our authority, @	
the @0 @ @y us for edification, and not for @ destruction,
I @M not be ashamed: 10:9 @Ç I may not seem as if I @
terrify you by letters.

10:10 For his letters, say @, are weighty and powerful; but his
bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.

10:11 Let such an one think @, @, such as we are in @W by
letters @ we are absent, such @ we be @! in deed @ we are
present.

10:12 For we dare not @3 ourselves of the number, or compare
ourselves @ some @ commend @ž: but @ measuring
@ž by @ž, and comparing @ž @> @ž,
are not wise.

10:13 But we @ not boast of @, @› our measure, but

a measure to reach @) @ you.

10:14 For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we

our measure, @ is, of @„ men's labours; but having hope, @
@ faith is increased, @ we @ be enlarged by you @N to

1:8 But though we, or an angel @ @i, preach any @„ gospel

1:9 As we @

1:10 For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men?
for if I yet pleased men, I @M not be the @x of @j.

1:11 But I certify you, @l, @ the gospel @	 was preached

1:12 For I @L received it of man, @L was I taught it, but by

1:13 For ye @ @] of my conversation in @b past in the Jews'

1:15 But @ it pleased God, who separated me @ my @Ô's womb,

2:1 @( fourteen @r @. I @& up @^ to @H @

2:3 But @L Titus, who was @ me, being a Greek, was compelled

2:6 But of @6 who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever @ @, it

seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me: 2:7 But
contrariwise, @ @ saw @ the gospel of the uncircumcision was

2:8 (For he @ wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of

And @ James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived
the grace @ was @y @ me, @ @ƒ to me and Barnabas the

2:10 Only @ @ @ we @M remember the poor; the @Ê @

2:11 But @ Peter was @ to Antioch, I withstood him to the @,

2:12 For @ @ certain @ @ James, he did eat @ the

2:13 And the @„ Jews dissembled likewise @ him; insomuch @
Barnabas @! was carried @< @ @ dissimulation.

2:14 But @ I saw @ @ walked not uprightly @N to the

 @ Peter @ @ all, If @, being

why compellest @ the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?  2:15 We who

a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of

2:17 But if, while we seek to be justified by @j, we ourselves

2:18 For if I build @^ the @, @	 I destroyed, I @3 myself

2:19 For I @‡ the law am @± to the law, @ I @€ live @

2:20 I am crucified @ @j: neverthless I live; yet not I, but
@j liveth in me: and the @‰ @	 I now live in the @™ I live

2:21 I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if @Û @ by

3:1 O foolish Galatians, who @ bewitched you, @ ye @M not

3:5 He @I @ ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh

3:7 Know ye @I @ @ @	 are of faith, the @Ê are the

3:8 And the scripture, foreseeing @ God @ justify the heathen

3:10 For as @s as are of the works of the law are @§ the curse:

3:11 But @ no man is justified by the law in the @É of God, it

3:12 And the law is not of faith: but, The man @ doeth @ @

3:13 @j @ redeemed us @ the curse of the law, being @% a

3:15 Brethren, I @ @. the manner of men; Though it be but a

3:16 Now to Abraham and his seed @ the promises @%. He @* not,
And to seeds, as of @s; but as of one, And to thy seed, @	 is

3:17 And @ I say, @ the @à, @ was confirmed @ of

cannot disannul, @ it @M @3 the promise of @» effect.

3:18 For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no @X of promise:
but God @ƒ it to Abraham by promise.

3:19 Wherefore @J serveth the law? It was added @4 of
transgressions, till the seed @M @ to @P the promise was

3:20 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.

3:21 Is the law @J @" the promises of God? God forbid: for if
@ had @Ë a law @y @	 could @ @y @‰, verily

3:22 But the scripture @ concluded all @§ sin, @ the promise

3:24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to @Z us @ @j,

3:25 But @. @ faith is @, we are no longer @§ a

3:26 For ye are all the @ of God by faith in @j @8.

3:28 There is @L Jew nor Greek, @ is @L bond nor free,

3:29 And if ye be @j's, @J are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs
@N to the promise.

4:1 Now I say, @Ç the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth

4:8 Howbeit @J, @ ye knew not God, ye did service @ @ @

4:9 But now, @. @ ye @ known God, or rather are known of God,
how turn ye @^ to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye

4:11 I am afraid of you, lest I @ bestowed @ you labour in vain.

4:12 Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye @

4:13 Ye @R how @‡ infirmity of the @™ I preached the gospel

4:14 And my temptation @	 was in my @™ ye despised not, nor

4:15 Where is @J the blessedness ye @g of? for I bear you record,

4:16 Am I @I become @ enemy, @4 I tell you the truth?

4:21 Tell me, ye @ desire to be @§ the law, do ye not @“ the

bondmaid, the @„ by a freewoman.

4:23 But he who was of the bondwoman was born @. the @™; but he
of the freewoman was by promise.

4:24 Which @, are an allegory: for @6 are the two covenants;
the one @ the mount Sinai, @	 gendereth to bondage, @	 is
Agar.

4:25 For @ Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to
@H @	 now is, and is in bondage @ her @.

4:26 But @H @	 is above is free, @	 is the @Ô of us

4:27 For it is written, Rejoice, @ barren @ bearest not; break

4:28 Now we, @l, as Isaac was, are the @ of promise.

4:29 But as @J he @ was born @. the @™ persecuted him @

4:30 Nevertheless @\ @* the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and
her son: for the son of the bondwoman @ not be heir @ the son
of the freewoman.

4:31 So @J, @l, we are not @ of the bondwoman, but of

5:1 Stand fast @I in the liberty wherewith @j @ @% us

5:2 @e, I Paul say @ you, @ if ye be circumcised, @j

5:3 For I testify @^ to @+ man @ is circumcised, @ he is a

5:4 @j is become of no effect @ you, whosoever of you are

5:5 For we @‡ the Spirit wait for the hope of @Û by
faith.

5:6 For in @8 @j @L circumcision availeth any @q, nor

5:7 Ye did run well; who did hinder you @ ye @M not obey the

5:9 A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.

5:10 I @ confidence in you @‡ the @0, @ ye @ be @»

6:17 Wherein God, willing @X abundantly to shew @ the heirs of

7:1 For @ Melchisedec, @ of Salem, @p of the most @¨ God,
who met Abraham returning @ the slaughter of the @Í, and blessed

7:4 Now consider how @: @ man was, @ @P @) the patriarch

7:5 And verily @ @ are of the @/ of Levi, who receive the

7:7 And @› all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.

7:8 And here men @ die receive tithes; but @ he receiveth @,

7:9 And as I may so say, Levi @!, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes

7:10 For he was yet in the loins of his @C, @ Melchisedec met

7:11 If @I perfection @ by the Levitical priesthood, (for

7:13 For he of @P @6 @, are spoken pertaineth to @ˆ

7:14 For it is evident @ our @0 sprang out of Juda; of @

7:15 And it is yet far @X evident: for @ @. the similitude of

7:17 For he testifieth, @h art a @p for @ @. the order of

7:18 For @ is verily a disannulling of the commandment going

7:19 For the law @% nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better

7:20 And inasmuch as not @› an oath he was @% @p: 7:21 (For

8:1 Now of the @, @	 we @ spoken @ is the sum: We @

8:3 For @+ @¨ @p is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices:

8:4 For if he @ on @7, he @M not be a @p, seeing @

3:9 The @0 is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count

1:4 And @6 @, write we @ you, @ @ joy may be full.

1:5 @Ì @J is the message @	 we @ @] of him, and declare

1:6 If we say @ we @ fellowship @ him, and walk in darkness,
we lie, and do not the truth: 1:7 But if we walk in the light, as he
is in the light, we @ fellowship one @ @ˆ, and the @Œ of
@8 @j his Son cleanseth us @ all sin.

1:8 If we say @ we @ no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth

1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins, and to cleanse us @ all unrighteousness.

1:10 If we say @ we @ not sinned, we @3 him a liar, and his

2:1 My little @, @6 @, write I @ you, @ ye sin

And if any man sin, we @ an advocate @ the Father, @8 @j

2:3 And hereby we do @R @ we @R him, if we @Á his

2:4 He @ @*, I @R him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a

2:5 But whoso keepeth his @W, in him verily is the @Ø of God

2:6 He @ @* he abideth in him ought @t @! so to walk,

2:7 Brethren, I write no new commandment @ you, but an old

2:8 Again, a new commandment I write @ you, @	 @q is true in

2:9 He @ @* he is in the light, and hateth his @¤, is in

2:10 He @ loveth his @¤ abideth in the light, and @ is

2:11 But he @ hateth his @¤ is in darkness, and walketh in

2:12 I write @ you, little @, @4 @ sins are forgiven

2:13 I write @ you, @n, @4 ye @ known him @ is @

2:15 Love not the @æ, @L the @, @ are in the @æ. If
any man @Ø the @æ, the @Ø of the Father is not in him.

2:16 For all @ is in the @æ, the lust of the @™, and the lust

2:17 And the @æ passeth @<, and the lust @=: but he @

2:18 Little @, it is the last @b: and as ye @ @] @

2:22 Who is a liar but he @ denieth @ @8 is the @j? He is
antichrist, @ denieth the Father and the Son.

2:23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the @Ê @ not the Father: he @

2:24 Let @ @I abide in you, @	 ye @ @] @ the

2:28 And now, little @, abide in him; @, @ he @

3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth @! the law: for sin is
the transgression of the law.

3:5 And ye @R @ he was manifested to @U @< our sins; and in

3:6 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth @ not

3:7 Little @, let no man deceive you: he @ doeth

3:8 He @ committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth @

3:9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed

3:10 In @ the @ of God are manifest, and the @ of the

3:16 Hereby perceive we the @Ø of God, @4 he laid @- his @‰
